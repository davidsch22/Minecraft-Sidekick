Here are given fuller descriptions and pictures of the various structures found in a village. Village blueprints can be used to reproduce these structures manually.
The number of buildings composing a village can vary, and not every village is composed of all buildings at once. Apart from the well, which is unique and systematic, the number of buildings of each type is randomly generated, and increased in superflat worlds. Structures are picked from a weighted probability list (libraries are more common than butcher shops). There may be fewer buildings of a given type than the maximum allowed. The number of lamp posts has no restriction, as they are generated where no other buildings can be placed. Gravel or sandstone roads (depending on the type of village) are found between the buildings of the village and often extend beyond them.
