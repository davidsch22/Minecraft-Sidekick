Moss Stone Boulders are small, pyramid like structures made completely out of Moss Stone that only spawn in Mega Taiga Biomes. Moss Stone Boulders are actually shaped like a symmetrical 5 * 5 * 5 cube with each corner taken out, but always spawn with approximately half of them buried in the sediment.
In multiplayer, with the plug-in selling.
