Every specific group of blocks purposefully formed in Minecraft based on coding is part of a natural structure.
The Overworld contains numerous generated structures, at a wide variety of scales.
Biomes dictate the shape and height of the world. At this stage, the ground is made entirely of stone, with water filling in any empty space below layer 63, with exception for structures.
Mountains are hills with extreme slopes and cliffs. Prior to the Adventure Update, these highly mountainous landforms were found in all type of biomes, but from the Adventure Update onwards are very rare outside the extreme hills biome. They were generated as part of the terrain generation algorithm. Mountains can sometimes have a cave spawned in the middle. On Amplified, mountains are extremely common in all biomes except ocean and swamp biomes.
Floating Islands are structures that float in midair that are not connected to the ground, the sea, hills or cliffs. Floating "islands" are normally just random pieces of floating dirt and stone found near cliffs, but on rare occasions they can be large, floating structures that even have springs and trees on them. Floating Islands are most frequently found in the extreme hills, ice plains, ice mountains and mushroom island biomes, but can be found anywhere. Floating Islands are extremely easy to find on an amplified world.
Hollows are the opposite of floating islands. They look like caves, but they have nothing to do with cave generation. When there are many overhangs, they close together and create a hollow. They have exactly the same floor as the terrain above, depending on the biome that they are located in, unlike caves. Caves have no specific floor. Grass can generate inside too. When they generate under the sea level, the water generates inside them. They are extremely rare in the default world, but can be found in the customized world.
Hills are randomly generated pieces of land in the map. Like stairs, hills are always traverse-able to their lowest point by virtue of the algorithm which generates them; there is almost always a place on each level from where the next level can be accessed, meaning that the player can climb a hill one level at a time until they reach the top. Cases where this is not true are rare.
Beaches usually generate next to oceans and cover all nearby shorelines. They come in three varieties: sand beach, gravel beach, and stone beach. Sandstone is located below sand in sand beaches. Gravel beaches had no such border and thus pose dangers like falling into caverns located right underneath them. Stone beaches have cliffs near the ocean.
The uppermost layers of the terrain are converted to a biome-dependent material: usually grass blocks and dirt, or sand in deserts and beaches. Podzol is found in mega taiga, and red sand is found in the mesa biome. Sandstone is generated under sand.
Occasionally, instead of being converted to dirt or sand, the top layer is stripped away, leaving a 'basin' of bare stone. There is a common misconception in the community that these are errors; however, they are an intended feature (however, some confirmed bugs create basin-like effects as well). They bear some resemblance to a geological 'shield' (an area of tectonically stable rock that has been exposed to prolonged erosion due to its very old age; it is distinct from the geological term "basin"). They seem to be more common in Forest or Plains, and are sometimes seen filled with water. Sometimes, common minerals can be found on the surface such ascoal ore and iron ore.
Oceans/Seas are huge bodies of water with every single water tile being a source block. The ground can rise high enough to produce small, relatively barren islands. Prior to the Adventure Update, oceans were generated as part of the terrain generation algorithm, but since then, they are part of the ocean biome. Deep oceans have a chance to spawn with an ocean monument.
Rivers are long "strands" of water that cut through or separate biomes. They do not have a current. Rivers have also been known to be a reliable source of clay. In hilly or mountainous areas, the ground can rise above layer 62, producing a dry riverbed.
Caverns are caves and tunnels that are automatically generated under the ground in various places. Caverns are composed mainly of stone, and contain large amounts of ores. Some of the sand around cave entrances can be found compressed into the respective sandstone.
Ravines are tall, long cracks of air, usually measuring around 30 to 50 blocks in height, making them quite dangerous if one should fall down. However, they are narrow, usually no more than 5 blocks wide. Ravines can have small ledges along the top, which can be traversed with relative ease. Ravines can be found at any level and also sometimes appear on the world surface, forming canyons—a serious hazard when wandering around the countryside, as they may not be obvious until one is right at the edge… or over it. Such canyons do, from time to time, appear underwater where safe entry is possible. They can go very deep underground, sometimes spawning slimes or exposing diamond ore. If they reach deep enough, they may also be floored by the lava lakes at level 11, meaning you don't need to worry about mobs spawning as much - you've got an even worse hazard underneath. In the Amplified world type, ravines can reach from surface level to bedrock. Ravines can also be found in oceans or rivers having a waterfall from the river/ocean falling into them. Ravines can connect to caves, dungeons, abandoned mines, and any other generated structures. Due to the large surface area of their walls, ravines often have water and/or lava flowing down them (from springs in the walls, underground lakes, or even openings to the sea). The player can also add their own waterfall(s) from the edge in order to descend more safely but should be aware of potential threats such as lava flow and hostile mobs.
Abandoned mine shafts are structures generated underground which consist of branching mining tunnels with wooden supports and broken rails passing through it. This is also the only place in Minecraft where venomous cave spiders can be found. It is easy to get lost in the labyrinth if torches or other reminder blocks are not placed. Open areas generate with bridges instead of leaving floating platforms. They contain minecarts with chests that may have rare items such as diamonds and horse armor. They may also contain iron ingots, coal, pickaxes, and other useful items. They are likely to expose veins of coal, iron, lapis lazuli, gold ore, and rarely, emerald and diamond ore.
Strongholds are structures that contain multiple rooms, doors and other aspects (some of these rooms include libraries, fountain rooms, dungeon-like rooms, etc.). There are three per world. Stone brick, mossy stone brick, cracked stone brick, doors, iron bars, Monster eggs and stone slabs are the materials that make up the strongholds. They also contain silverfish, which one should be careful of when digging around in strongholds. Portals to The End are found in specific rooms in strongholds. Chests may be found containing items such as books, Redstone, Ender pearls, apples, bread, compasses, iron tools/armor, and diamonds. Strongholds can be found by right clicking an Eye of Ender, which will be thrown into the air and point the direction where the End Portal is, showing the way to the Stronghold.
The quantity of most of these features (aside from lakes, mineral veins, and springs) is biome-dependent; not all features can be found in every biome. (Example: A small jungle maze/trap made out of cobblestone, redstone, dispensers, arrows, wooden pressure plates and a chest that usually will contain an iron tool/weapon).
Lakes are small bodies of a liquid. Water lakes can now be generated above sea level or inside caverns, and are small bodies of water surrounded simply by dirt or sand. When in a winter biome, these small lakes are never initially frozen but can turn to ice. The lakes can also be composed of lava; however, lakes of lava are rarer. Lava lakes found at the surface may be surrounded by gravel, sand, stone, and coal ore. Both types of lake generate with a small air pocket above them, which may result in floating sand, floating snow cover or even the top 2/3rds of trees above the lake. Lava lakes may cause trees to burn this way.
Dungeons are small, mostly underground, one-room spaces bordered by moss stone and cobblestone, and typically contain chests with rare items, and a hostile monster spawner in the center, which guards the chests. Dungeons generate with either a zombie (50% chance), skeleton (25% chance), or spider (25% chance) spawner. Occasionally a player may find that the spawner is covered with gravel and will be harder to reach, yet the mobs can still spawn with the gravel around it. The chests may contain rare valuables, such as music discs, enchanted books, saddles, horse armor, and golden apples. Rarely, there may be two dungeons generated right next to each other, this can make two dungeons in only about one space. There have also been reports of three or more dungeons in very close proximity to each other. There is a small chance of not getting a chest. Sometimes, two chests in a dungeon can spawn so that the chests are next to each other, which turns them into a single large chest. Dungeons generated in a desert can sometimes be visible from the surface due to the sand falling down.
A mineral Vein is a natural deposit of ores. Players can come across these veins in caverns or anywhere where there is natural stone. Underground deposits of dirt and gravel are generated in this step, followed by the more precious ores: coal, iron, gold, Redstone, diamond, emerald (in extreme hill biomes) and lapis lazuli. They can only form in Stone, and do not replace each other or any other block.
Trees are common structures created both during world generation and by players (grown from saplings). They are made of wood and leaves. Tree sizes range from small trees that can be fully harvested from ground level, to large trees that may require several minutes to harvest.
Huge Mushrooms are structures that only naturally occur in mushroom island biomes and roofed forest biomes. They are composed of mushroom stalks and either red or brown colored blocks for the cap. They can be grown outside mushroom islands by fertilizing red or brown mushroom with bone meal, or can be generated with mycelium. Huge mushrooms can also be found anywhere in AMPLIFIED, but each will spawn with groups of 1-5 mushrooms per group.
Springs are randomly generated blocks of either lava or water that act as a source of their respective material. While both can be found on the vertical side of stone blocks above the surface, lava springs are more often found underground beneath layer 32 in caverns. Both of these sources can be collected and moved via the use of buckets. Springs can only be found in versions from Infdev onward, as fluids behaved differently in older versions.
These well-like structures built of sandstone blocks and slabs generate only in the desert biome. Although assumed to be wells, their exact purpose and function is yet to be known. A proposed reason would be for filling buckets with water, since the middle water spring is infinite. Also, it is possible for a well to spawn over a stronghold or an abandoned mineshaft. They have a 1/1000 chance to be generated in any desert chunk, which makes them a rare sight. It is possible for a well to generate around a cactus. The well structure can also spawn even with the "Generate Structures" setting disabled.
These structures are meant to represent boulders, made entirely of moss stone. The formation of these structures vary possibly infinitely. They can be found dotted around areas of the mega taiga biome. Due to the wide variety in shape they often appear to just be a patch of moss stone on the ground rather than a boulder. They provide an easier source of moss stone than do dungeons and jungle temples. However, as with ice spikes, Moss stone boulders are quite rare, due to the mega taiga biome's rarity. They are rarely big enough to live in.
Ice spikes are tall spires made of packed ice. The spikes can only be found in the ice plains spikes. There are two variants of ice spikes: one is short and thick, and the other is extremely tall and thin.
Buildings are naturally generating structures that form above ground. They can contain valuable treasure, but traps and puzzles as well.
Villages are generated in desert, plains and savanna biomes and are a site for villagers, who can be traded with. They are composed of a random selection of various buildings and farms. There is always exactly one well, other buildings can be any of several different houses, single or double farms, blacksmith's shop, library, butcher's shop, or church. Villages are built with different materials depending on their biome: Oak wood and cobblestone for plains and savanna villages, sandstone for desert villages. Villages RARELY generate partly submerged in water, although this is more prominent in the Console editions. The Villagers move about in the area around the village, retreating indoors at night and during storms. Villagers vary in their professions (indicated by their clothing), which affects the items they will trade. Villages have little paths to join all houses. Sand villages have roads to join them.
Desert temples, also known as pyramids, are found in deserts. They mainly consist of sandstone and stained clay. In the middle of the temple is a block of blue stained clay, which if destroyed, reveals a deep, hidden chamber underneath, where players can find 4 chests, which can contain valuable loot, and a stone pressure plate trap connected to a 3×3 grid of TNT. Treasures found in the chests include emeralds, diamonds, iron ingots, gold ingots, rotten flesh, enchanted books, and bones. While rotten flesh, bones and gold ingots are found frequently, other treasures are not as common.
Jungle temples are found in jungles, and mainly consist of cobblestone and mossy cobblestone. There are three floors, the bottom floor containing a chest and a puzzle. The chest is found through a corridor which contains hidden tripwires that triggers a dispenser to shoot arrows at the player. The player must carefully navigate through the corridor while triggering the tripwires. The puzzle is located at the opposite of the corridor and consists of three levers that must be pulled in the correct order to open a secret door which reveals another chest. While both chests can contain rare loot, the puzzle chest usually contains the more valuable ones, such as diamonds and emeralds.
Witch Huts generate in swamp biomes. Witches spawn inside of them. The huts consist of spruce wood planks and oak wood. Spruce wood stairs make the roof borders, 2 fences decorate the entrance, one fence makes the front window bars, and one fence makes the back window bars. Inside is a crafting table and an empty cauldron. Potted mushrooms decorate the windowsills. There are no chests or any other loot inside. Strangely, witch hut ceilings are just high enough for the witches to fit inside, but their hats protrude into the ceiling, making the animation look broken. There is no valid way a witch can get back up into a hut if it falls out of one (other than player intervention or the extremely rare case of one or more endermen building a staircase by accident, or if the Witch Hut spills onto a neighbouring biome that provides access from a hill).
Ocean monuments are structures that spawn in deep oceans. They spawn in the shape of a pyramid with many rooms. They are composed of prismarine, sea lanterns and prismarine bricks. The only valuables found here are 8 gold blocks encased in dark prismarine and a random assortment of Sponges. Guardians and Elder Guardians spawn here only.
The Nether, though equally vast, contains far fewer types of generated structures than the Overworld.
Lava seas are found at and below level 30 in the Nether. They make a large portion of the Nether, and are extremely common. They can stretch for hundreds, if not thousands, of meters in any direction, and are usually bordered by netherrack (or more rarely soul sand). Even on far render distance, the player is rarely able to see the other side of the seas due to their vastness.
Nether fortresses are very large complexes made mainly of nether bricks (with added nether brick fences and stairs to be found). Due to this, it is very easy to get lost in them and it may be difficult to navigate back to portals. Nether fortresses can often tunnel through netherrack, and the inside of the tunnels will be cleared of netherrack by the terrain generator. Blaze spawners and nether wart farms are only found in nether fortresses. Aside from the spawners, blazes can spawn anywhere in the fortresses, and there are also not only zombie pigmen, but wither skeletons as well. Nether fortresses have some chests. The chests with loot are usually generated in corners.
The Nether Spire is a tall structure that is generated by activating the Nether Reactor. The Nether Spire is completely made out of Netherrack (formerly Obsidian due to Netherrack being unimplemented). After the Nether Reactor's "energy" runs out, the Spire becomes damaged with several holes that allow the player to exit the area, and the time will fast-forward to nighttime. The floor above the reactor contains an area where Mob Farming can be performed. If the player can make it to a higher place of the Spire, it can be climbable. This the only legitimate way to get Netherrack in Survival mode. If the Nether Reactor Core is broken before mob/item spawning is finished, the Nether Spire will not break.
Glowstone clusters are typically veins of glowstone that can be among the hardest natural materials to harvest that don't require digging. They form in coral-like structures on the underside of hanging Netherrack, so they are often found on the ceilings of the Nether, where they provide light along with the ever present lava. Luckily, there are places where the ceiling is very low, and veins there can usually be mined without undue risk.
There are areas of soul sand and gravel around layer 64, and as of the 1.5 update, there are nether quartz ore veins and "hidden lava", which is a single block of lava in random places not visible without digging.
The End is the most barren dimension, with only four types of significant structures.
Most of the End is a large, asteroid-like island composed entirely of end stone, floating in an endless void.
Obsidian pillars, or obsidian towers, are tall, tower-like structures that generate in The End. No part of them are in the ground; there is no obsidian below the lowest block of obsidian that the player can see without digging. Ender crystals will spawn on top of each one to heal the Ender Dragon. On the Console Edition, the Pillars are generated in a Circle around the fountain. Two of the ender crystals are surrounded in iron bars, which must be destroyed before the crystal can be taken out. Obsidian pillars can be hollow.
The obsidian platform is a 5 by 5 square of obsidian that the player spawns once they enter The End. (Note that if the obsidian is destroyed, or if a block is placed on top of it, when the player returns to the End, the obsidian will be restored and any blocks on top of it will despawn.) Obsidian platforms mostly spawn far away from the island, making it tough to get there.
  Sometimes the platform spawns inside a case of end stone. It will remove enough end stone so that the player can walk around.
  Occasionally the platform will spawn in midair.
  Very rarely, the platform will spawn on an obsidian pillar and have an Ender crystal on it.
The exit end portal, in the shape of a fountain is found once the Ender Dragon is defeated, giving the player a way back to the overworld. This fountain is also the foundation of the Ender Dragon Egg. After entering the fountain, the Minecraft credits come on the screen, implying that you have "beaten the game" (despite the fact that the game never ends). You can skip these credits by pressing Esc. After the credits have finished (or after you skipped them), the player returns to the last bed they slept in (or their original spawn spot if the bed was obstructed). The fountain is also made of bedrock, making it indestructible. On the Xbox 360 Edition, the fountain is generated in between the Pillars, and already exists before the Ender Dragon is killed. The Enderdragon will also fly above the fountain when the player approaches it, and spew Ender Acid. In addition, the ender dragon will defend the fountain from endermen every 3 minutes or so.
Structures are generated for a given chunk after the terrain has been formed. The chunk format includes a tag called TerrainPopulated that indicates whether structures whose point of origin is in that chunk have been generated. If it is false or missing, they will be generated again. Structure generation is based on what is already in the chunk, so (for example) flagging a chunk that has already been populated for repopulation will approximately double the amount of ore in it. When structures are generated, they can spill over into neighbouring chunks that have been previously generated. Thus, a tree at the edge of the generated world (and probably only visible using external tools) may be overwritten by a lake before you reach it. It is also theoretically possible for two worlds generated with the same seed, from the same version of Minecraft, to differ slightly depending on the players' travel routes, because the order in which chunks are generated may determine which of two conflicting structures will overwrite or suppress the other.
Every specific group of blocks purposefully formed in Minecraft based on coding is part of a natural structure.
The Overworld contains numerous generated structures, at a wide variety of scales.
Biomes dictate the shape and height of the world. At this stage, the ground is made entirely of stone, with water filling in any empty space below layer 63, with exception for structures.
Mountains are hills with extreme slopes and cliffs. Mountains can sometimes have caves through them. On an amplified, mountains are extremely common in all biomes except ocean and swamp biomes. A picture of an extreme hills biome.
 A large overhang, occasionally found in extreme hills biomes.

Floating "islands" are structures that float in midair that are not connected to the ground, the sea, hills or cliffs. Floating "islands" are normally just random pieces of floating dirt and stone found near cliffs, but on rare occasions they can be large, floating structures that even have springs and trees on them. Floating Islands are most frequently found in the extreme hills, ice plains, ice mountains and mushroom island biomes, but can be found anywhere. Floating Islands are very common an amplified world.
 It is rare to see a naturally occurring, large, floating "island".

Hollows are the opposite of floating islands. They look like caves, but they have nothing to do with cave generation. When there are many overhangs, they close together and create a hollow. They have exactly the same floor as the terrain above, depending on the biome that they are located in, unlike caves. Caves have no specific floor. Grass can generate inside too. When they generate under the sea level, the water generates inside them. They are extremely rare in the default world, but can be found in the customized world. A hollow in a customized world.

Hills are randomly generated pieces of land in the map. Like stairs, hills are always traverse-able to their lowest point by virtue of the algorithm which generates them; there is almost always a place on each level from where the next level can be accessed, meaning that the player can climb a hill one level at a time until they reach the top. Cases where this is not true are rare. A randomly-generated hill with some tall grass and trees.
Beaches usually generate next to oceans and cover all nearby shorelines. They come in three varieties: sand beach, gravel beach, and stone beach. Sandstone is located below sand in sand beaches. Gravel beaches had no such border and thus pose dangers like falling into caverns located right underneath them. Stone beaches have cliffs near the ocean.

The uppermost layers of the terrain are converted to a biome-dependent material: usually grass blocks and dirt, or sand in deserts and beaches. Podzol is found in mega taiga, and red sand is found in the mesa biome. Sandstone is generated under sand.
Occasionally, instead of being converted to dirt or sand, the top layer is stripped away, leaving a 'basin' of bare stone. They bear some resemblance to a geological 'shield' (an area of tectonically stable rock that has been exposed to prolonged erosion due to its very old age; it is distinct from the geological term "basin"). They seem to be more common in forest or plains, and are occasionally seen filled with water. Sometimes, common minerals can be found on the surface such as coal ore and iron ore.

Oceans/Seas are huge bodies of water with every single water tile being a source block. The ground can rise high enough to produce small, relatively barren islands. Prior to the Adventure Update, oceans were generated as part of the terrain generation algorithm, but since then, they are part of the ocean biome.
Deep oceans have a chance to spawn with an ocean monument. A picture of an ocean biome.
Rivers are long "strands" of water that cut through or separate biomes. They do not have a current. Rivers have also been known to be a reliable source of clay. In hilly or mountainous areas, the ground can rise above layer 62, producing a dry riverbed.

Lakes are small bodies of a liquid. Water lakes can now be generated above sea level or inside caverns, and are small bodies of water surrounded simply by dirt or sand (But they are rarely big). When in a winter biome, these small lakes are never initially frozen but can turn to ice. The lakes can also be composed of lava; however, lakes of lava are rarer. Lava lakes found at the surface may be surrounded by gravel, sand, stone, and coal ore. Both types of lake generate with a small air pocket above them, which may result in floating sand, floating snow cover or even the top 2/3rds of trees above the lake. Lava lakes may cause trees to burn this way.

Caverns are caves and tunnels that are automatically generated under the ground in various places. Caverns are composed mainly of stone, and contain large amounts of ores. Some of the sand around cave entrances can be found compressed into the respective sandstone.
 A dark cave with a zombie.
Ravines are tall, long cracks of air, usually measuring around 30 to 50 blocks in height, and usually no more than 5 blocks wide. Ravines can have small ledges along the top. They can be found at any level and also sometimes appear on the world surface or underwater, forming canyons. They can go very deep underground, sometimes spawning slimes or exposing diamond ore. If they reach deep enough, they may also be floored by the lava lakes at level 11. In the Amplified world type, ravines can reach from surface level to bedrock. Ravines can also be found in oceans or rivers having a waterfall from the river/ocean falling into them.
Ravines can connect to caves, dungeons, abandoned mines, and any other generated structures. Due to the large surface area of their walls, ravines often have water and/or lava flowing down them (from springs in the walls, underground lakes, or even openings to the sea).

Abandoned mine shafts are structures generated underground which consist of branching mining tunnels with wooden supports and broken rails passing through it. Cave spider spawners can be found in mine shafts. Open areas generate with bridges instead of leaving floating platforms. They contain minecarts with chests that may have rare items such as diamonds and horse armor. They may also contain iron ingots, coal, pickaxes, and other useful items. They are likely to expose veins of coal, iron, lapis lazuli, gold ore, and rarely, emerald and diamond ore.

Strongholds are structures that contain multiple rooms, doors and other aspects (some of these rooms include libraries, fountain rooms, dungeon-like rooms, etc.). There are three per world. Stone brick, mossy stone brick, cracked stone brick, doors, iron bars, monster eggs and stone slabs are the materials that make up the strongholds. They also contain silverfish, which one should be careful of when digging around in strongholds. Portals to The End are found in specific rooms in strongholds. Chests may be found containing items such as books, redstone, ender pearls, apples, bread, compasses, iron tools/armor, and diamonds. Strongholds can be found by right clicking an eye of ender, which will be thrown into the air and point the direction where the End portal is, showing the way to the stronghold.
 The first picture of a stronghold. Currently, they are almost entirely underground.
The quantity of most of these features (aside from lakes, mineral veins, and springs) is biome-dependent; not all features can be found in every biome.
Dungeons are small, mostly underground, one-room spaces bordered by moss stone and cobblestone, and typically contain chests with rare items, and a hostile monster spawner in the center. Dungeons generate with either a zombie (50% chance), skeleton (25% chance), or spider (25% chance) spawner. Occasionally a player may find that the spawner is covered with gravel and will be harder to reach, yet the mobs can still spawn with the gravel around it. The chests may contain rare valuables, such as music discs, enchanted books, saddles, horse armor, and golden apples. Rarely, multiple dungeons can generate next to each other. Dungeons generated in a desert can sometimes be visible from the surface due to the sand falling down. A dungeon with a monster spawner in the center, and two chests. The torch was placed by the player.

A mineral vein is a natural deposit of ores. Players can come across these veins in caverns or anywhere where there is natural stone. Underground deposits of dirt and gravel are generated in this step, followed by the more precious ores: coal, iron, gold, redstone, diamond, emerald (in extreme hill biomes) and lapis lazuli. They can only form in stone, and do not replace each other or any other block. Note that two or more mineral veins can form next to each other and make it look like a mineral vein made of more than one material.

Trees are common structures created both during world generation and by players (grown from saplings). They are made of wood and leaves. Tree sizes range from small trees that can be fully harvested from ground level, to large trees that may require several minutes to harvest.
 A variety of tree types.
 A spruce forest.

Huge mushrooms are structures that only naturally occur in mushroom island biomes and roofed forest biomes. They are composed of mushroom stalks and either red or brown colored blocks for the cap. They can be grown outside mushroom islands by fertilizing red or brown mushroom with bone meal, or can be generated with mycelium. Huge mushrooms can also be found anywhere in an amplified world, but each will spawn with groups of 1-5 mushrooms per group. Red and brown huge mushrooms seen on a mushroom island.
Springs are randomly generated blocks of either lava or water that act as a source of their respective material. While both can be found on the vertical side of stone blocks above the surface, lava springs are more often found underground beneath layer 32 in caverns.

These well-like structures built of sandstone blocks and slabs generate only in the desert biome. They have a 1/1000 chance to be generated in any desert chunk, which makes them a rare sight. It is possible for a well to generate around a cactus. The well structure can also spawn even with the "Generate Structures" setting disabled. The well structure.

These structures are meant to represent boulders, made entirely of moss stone. The formation of these structures vary possibly infinitely. They can be found dotted around areas of the mega taiga biome. Due to the wide variety in shape they often appear to just be a patch of moss stone on the ground rather than a boulder. Moss stone boulders are quite rare, due to the mega taiga biome's rarity.

Ice spikes are tall spires made of packed ice. The spikes can only be found in the ice plains spikes. There are two variants of ice spikes: one is short and thick, and the other is extremely tall and thin.
 An ice plains spikes, largely covered by ice spikes. Both types of ice spikes are visible.
Buildings are naturally generating structures that form above ground. They can contain valuable treasure, but traps and puzzles as well.
Villages are generated in desert, plains and savanna biomes and are a site for villagers, who can be traded with. They are composed of a random selection of various buildings and farms. There is always exactly one well, other buildings can be any of several different houses, single or double farms, blacksmith's shop, library, butcher's shop, or church. Villages are built with different materials depending on their biome: Oak wood and cobblestone for plains and savanna villages, sandstone for desert villages. Villages may generate partly submerged in water, although this is more prominent in the Console editions. The Villagers move about in the area around the village, retreating indoors at night and during storms. Villages have little paths to join all houses. Sand villages have roads to join them.

Desert temples, also known as pyramids, are found in deserts. They mainly consist of sandstone and stained clay. In the middle of the temple is a block of blue stained clay, which if destroyed, reveals a deep, hidden chamber underneath, where players can find 4 chests, which can contain valuable loot, and a stone pressure plate trap connected to a 3×3 grid of TNT. Treasures found in the chests include emeralds, diamonds, iron ingots, gold ingots, rotten flesh, enchanted books, and bones. While rotten flesh, bones and gold ingots are found frequently, other treasures are not as common. The front side of the temple.

Jungle temples are found in jungles, and mainly consist of cobblestone and mossy cobblestone. There are three floors, the bottom floor containing a chest and a puzzle. The chest is found through a corridor which contains hidden tripwires that triggers a dispenser to shoot arrows at the player. The player must carefully navigate through the corridor while triggering the tripwires. The puzzle is located at the opposite of the corridor and consists of three levers that must be pulled in the correct order to open a secret door which reveals another chest. While both chests can contain rare loot, the puzzle chest usually contains the more valuable ones, such as diamonds and emeralds.
Witch huts generate in swamp biomes. Witches spawn inside of them. There are no chests or any other loot inside.The witch hut ceilings are just high enough for the witches to fit inside, but their hats protrude into the ceiling. There is no valid way a witch can get back up into a hut if it falls out of one.

Ocean monuments are underwater structures that spawn in deep oceans. They spawn in the shape of a pyramid with many rooms. They are composed of prismarine, sea lanterns and prismarine bricks. The only valuables found here are 8 gold blocks encased in dark prismarine and a random assortment of sponges. Guardians and elder guardians spawn here.
The Nether, though equally vast, contains far fewer types of generated structures than the Overworld.
Lava seas are found at and below level 30 in the Nether. They make a large portion of the Nether, and are extremely common. They can stretch for hundreds of meters in any direction, and are usually bordered by netherrack (or more rarely soul sand). Even on far render distance, the player is rarely able to see the other side of the seas due to their vastness.

Nether fortresses are very large complexes made mainly of nether bricks (with added nether brick fences and stairs to be found). Nether fortresses can often tunnel through netherrack, and the inside of the tunnels will be cleared of netherrack by the terrain generator. Blaze spawners and nether wart farms are only found in nether fortresses. Blazes, zombie pigmen and wither skeletons can spawn anywhere in the fortress. Nether fortresses have some chests. The chests with loot are usually generated in corners. A nether fortress generated in the Nether.
Glowstone clusters are typically veins of glowstone that can be among the hardest natural materials to harvest that don't require digging. They form in coral-like structures on the underside of hanging Netherrack, so they are often found on the ceilings of the Nether, where they provide light along with the ever present lava.
There are areas of soul sand and gravel around layer 64, nether quartz ore veins and "hidden lava", which is a single block of lava in random places not visible without digging.
The End is the most barren dimension, with only four types of significant structures.
Most of the End is a large, asteroid-like island composed entirely of end stone, floating in an endless void.
Obsidian pillars, or obsidian towers, are tall, tower-like structures that generate in The End. No part of them are in the ground; there is no obsidian below the lowest block of obsidian that the player can see without digging. Ender crystals will spawn on top of each one to heal the Ender Dragon.
On the Console Edition, the pillars are generated in a circle around the fountain. Two of the ender crystals are surrounded by iron bars, which must be destroyed before the crystal can be taken out.
The obsidian platform is a 5 by 5 square of obsidian that the player spawns once they enter The End. (Note that if the obsidian is destroyed, or if a block is placed on top of it, when the player or any other entity enters the End, the obsidian will be restored and any blocks on top of it will despawn.) Obsidian platforms mostly spawn far away from the island, making it tough to get there. Sometimes the platform spawns inside a case of end stone. It will remove enough end stone so that the player can walk around.
 Occasionally the platform will spawn in midair.
 Very rarely, the platform will spawn on an obsidian pillar and have an Ender crystal on it.
The exit end portal, in the shape of a fountain is found once the Ender Dragon is defeated, giving the player a way back to the overworld. This fountain is also the foundation of the Ender Dragon Egg. After entering the fountain, the Minecraft credits come on the screen, implying that you have "beaten the game" (despite the fact that the game never ends). You can skip these credits by pressing Esc. After the credits have finished (or after you skipped them), the player returns to the last bed they slept in (or their original spawn spot if the bed was obstructed). The fountain is also made of bedrock, making it indestructible.
On the Console Edition, the fountain is generated in between the Pillars, and already exists before the Ender Dragon is killed. The Enderdragon will also fly above the fountain when the player approaches it, and spew Ender Acid. In addition, the ender dragon will defend the fountain from endermen every 3 minutes or so. Obsidian pillars in the End before ender crystals were added. Endermen are also visible.
Structures are generated for a given chunk after the terrain has been formed. The chunk format includes a tag called TerrainPopulated that indicates whether structures whose point of origin is in that chunk have been generated. If it is false or missing, they will be generated again. Structure generation is based on what is already in the chunk, so (for example) flagging a chunk that has already been populated for repopulation will approximately double the amount of ore in it.
When structures are generated, they can spill over into neighbouring chunks that have been previously generated. Thus, a tree at the edge of the generated world (and probably only visible using external tools) may be overwritten by a lake before you reach it. It is also theoretically possible for two worlds generated with the same seed, from the same version of Minecraft, to differ slightly depending on the players' travel routes, because the order in which chunks are generated may determine which of two conflicting structures will overwrite or suppress the other.
In previous versions when snow cover wasn't solid a Lava Lake leaving floating snow cover above it could be a deadly trap in the first 2 minutes after being generated (longer than that and the snow melts).
