Jungle temples are generated structures found in jungle biomes.
Jungle temples generate naturally in jungles.
Jungle temples consist of cobblestone, moss stone and 3 chiseled stone bricks. There are 3 floors.
The bottom floor contains a puzzle, consisting of 3 levers on 3 chiseled stone bricks connected to a hidden piston trapdoor mechanism. Inside the room the trapdoor opens to is a chest.
Down the hall from the above puzzle, there is a way to a chest. The trap consists of 2 tripwire lines connected to dispensers with 4-14 arrows, hidden behind vines. The first tripwire is in the beginning of way; the second tripwire is in front of the chest.
Each chest contains 2-6 stacks of items, chosen from the following list (the same as desert temples). Chance listed is per stack, not for the chest as a whole.
