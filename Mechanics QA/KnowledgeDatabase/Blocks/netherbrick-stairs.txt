Netherbrick stairs are part of Nether fortresses in which theyâ€™re only used as stairs, despite their decorative potential. They can easily be mined with a pickaxe. Diamond pickaxes are recommended for their speed, as even an iron pickaxe will take a while to break this block. Netherbrick stairs can also be created by using 6 netherbricks.
