Grass Path is a type of grass revealed to be added in 1.9. To obtain it you need to right-click grass with a shovel, similar to hoes and farmland.
The usage of pressed dirt is possibly for trails and roads. The idea was suggested by Reddit user LucasX. Jeb saw it and decided to add it to Minecraft PC and PE. The PE screenshot shows the player holding a shovel while with the pressed dirt, which could mean the shovel would be used to create the block. PE Dev Tommaso released a screenshot showing what villages would look like with the gravel roads being replaced with pressed dirt.
