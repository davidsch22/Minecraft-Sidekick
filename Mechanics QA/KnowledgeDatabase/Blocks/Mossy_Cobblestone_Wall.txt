The Mossy Cobblestone Wall is a block designed for aesthetic purposes and to be an alternative to fences. They work very similarly to fences, as their hitboxes are 1.5 blocks. Similar to a fence post you can put torches on any part of the block, same goes for the other variant; Cobblestone Wall.
Mobs do not recognize cobblestone walls as obstacles. As such, if cobblestone walls block a mob's path, they will simply walk into them. An example of this is if a house has cobblestone walls bordering an entrance door. Villagers will walk against the wall instead of going around, rendering them mostly unable to enter the building.
