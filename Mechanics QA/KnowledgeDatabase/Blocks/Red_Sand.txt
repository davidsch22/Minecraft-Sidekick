Red Sand is a block added to Minecraft in Update 1.7. and can be found in the Mesa Biome.Â This block is also affected by gravity, like its Desert Biome counterpart.
It was first added to Minecraft in Snapshot 13w39a.
It can be used to make TNT and Glass, but not Sandstone.
It has a 2.5 blast resistance, like normal sand.
Apart from color, the textures for the two sands are the same.
As of Minecraft 1.8 update you can craft Red Sandstone out of red sand.
