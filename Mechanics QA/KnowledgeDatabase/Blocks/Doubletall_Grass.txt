Doubletall grass is a variant of tall grass that was introduced in Snapshot 13w36a. Doubletall grass is two blocks tall, and sometimes yields seeds when broken, like normal grass. It cannot be harvested and can only be seen by using Bone Meal on normal grass. Doubletall grass also provides a way to hide from creepers simply crouch in a doubletall variant and they will stop following you.
