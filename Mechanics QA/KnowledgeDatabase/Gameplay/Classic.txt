Classic Mode was a developmental stage in Minecraft implemented by Notch. It has since been replaced with Creative mode.
You have to play Minecraft PC for free in order to play Classic mode.
Unlike the Alpha, Beta and Minecraft 1.0 versions of Minecraft, you can not craft items or inflict damage.
Much like Creative Mode, there are an infinite amount of blocks the player can use at their disposal, although, you can only place the old textured cobblestone. However, unlike Creative Mode, Minecraft Classic does not allow the player the ability to fly (without the use of mods or plug-ins).
Minecraft Classic was the original version of Minecraft. It was originally given away for free, however now it is bundled with the release edition.
Minecraft Classic does not include any mobs, except the players themselves (as Minecraft Classic does support Multiplayer as well as Singleplayer).
In minecraft classic, the player is limited on how far he can explore, as the worlds were limited in size.
As is with all editions of Minecraft, Minecraft Classic is a sandbox game. This means there are no objectives and no unlocks - the player is free to do what they like.
As with most early Minecraft editions, worlds are generated randomly and have limited space.
Unlike the Alpha, Beta or Release editions of Minecraft, sponges have the ability to absorb water.
Singleplayer is a mode within Minecraft Classic that, once selected, places the player in a world surrounded by fog. In this world, the player can use the infinite amount of materials available to them to create whatever they please.
Guests to the Minecraft website can play Minecraft Classic for free, however the links to access it are no longer on the front page, making anyone without the link unable to play.
Guests cannot save their levels like Premium users can; as Premium users can save their levels in the browser, whilst non-premium members must save any levels as a save file.
Multiplayer within Minecraft Classic allows for several players to connect via a server. Servers in Minecraft Classic are operated in a very similar fashion to that of Servers on Minecraft Alpha, Beta, and Release.
As with current Minecraft servers, Minecraft Classic servers are compatible with mods and plug-ins.
Worlds in Minecraft Classic Multiplayer are an identical size to that of worlds in Minecraft Classic Singleplayer.
