Raw Rabbit is a food item added in Minecraft 1.8 and replenishes 1 and a half bars of hunger. It can be obtained by killing a Rabbit and 0-1 are dropped each time. If you put it in a Furnace and cook it, you'll get Cooked Rabbit.  Like Raw Chicken, the amount of raw rabbit that is dropped is unaffected by looting.
 Raw Rabbit and Raw Chicken are the only two foods that, when dropped by mobs, drop all their meat. Cows and pigs drop 1/4 of their meat.
Raw Rabbit is a food item that can be eaten by the player, or cooked in a furnace to make cooked rabbit.
Rabbits will drop raw rabbit upon death. 0-1 are dropped each time. The amount that is dropped is unaffected by the looting enchantment.
To eat raw rabbit, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 3 () hunger and 1.8 hunger saturation.
Raw rabbit can also be used to heal or breed tamed wolves.
