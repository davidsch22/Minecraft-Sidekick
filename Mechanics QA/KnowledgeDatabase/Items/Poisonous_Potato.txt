A poisonous potato is a food item that can poison the player.
The poisonous potato is a rare drop when harvesting (destroying) potato plants: a fully grown plant has a 2% chance of dropping one in addition to the 1–4 regular potatoes. Poisonous potatoes have a higher chance of dropping under poor farming conditions.
Poisonous potatoes cannot be planted on farmland or baked.
A poisonous potato can be eaten, this restores 2 () and 1.2 saturation points, and has a 60% chance of applying 4 seconds of the Poison effect (draining 3 ()).
