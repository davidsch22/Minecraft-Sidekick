The Nether Star is an item drop from the wither that is used solely to craft beacons.
The nether star can only be obtained by defeating the wither. One nether star will be dropped each time, regardless of enchantments used to kill the mob.
Nether stars have the same animated glow that enchanted items and potions have.
The dropped nether star can not be destroyed by explosions. However, it can still be destroyed by fire, lava, and cacti.
