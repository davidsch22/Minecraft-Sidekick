Prismarine Crystals are items obtained by defeating Guardians and Elder Guardians.
Prismarine crystals are dropped by Guardians or Elder Guardians. 0-1 are dropped each time.
The drop only happens if the raw fish drop fails. Looting I gives the best chance (27%).
Prismarine crystals are dropped by sea lanterns when not using a silk touch tool. They drop 2-3 crystals each time, which can be increased to a maximum of 5 using the fortune enchantment.
