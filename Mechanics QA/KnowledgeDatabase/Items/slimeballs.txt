Slimeballs are dropped by slimes, which makes slimeballs one of the rarest items in game. They used to create sticky pistons and magma cream, an ingredient for brewing.
Farming slimeballs is a time intensive job, as slimes only occur in 10% of the chunks in the lowest 40 layers of the world. Tiny slimes are the only slimes that drop slimeballs (0-2 of them), so larger slimes first have to be killed in order to form smaller slimes.
