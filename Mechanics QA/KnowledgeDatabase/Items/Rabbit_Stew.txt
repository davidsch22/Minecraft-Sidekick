Rabbit Stew is a food item introduced in 1.8 that can be eaten.
Each bowl restores 5 bars of hunger and 12 saturation points. This restores more hunger than any other food type in the game except cake but less saturation than a Golden Carrot. .
However, if the ingredients of rabbit stew were eaten separately and the calculation for the mushroom used half of the values for Mushroom Stew, they would restore a total of 8 hunger bars and 21.6 saturation points. Without counting the mushroom (which cannot be eaten alone), the separate ingredients would restore 6.5 hunger bars and 18 saturation points. Therefore, crafting rabbit stew results in a net loss of restorative points.
As with mushroom stew, eating rabbit stew turns it into an empty bowl, but the sound played is the crunchy “eating” sound instead of the slurping “drinking” sound.
