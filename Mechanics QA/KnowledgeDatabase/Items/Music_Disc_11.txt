Music Disc 11 is a music disc that differs from the other discs, both in appearance, and in music. It's a shattered disc, and the recording seems to be of a person running across (or maybe breaking) different block types and later on, stopping to use equipment of some kind, cough, and then continue running with a hastened pace. The block sounds similar to that of dirt and stone. The person struggling, and haunting background noises are heard throughout the recording. Strange noises of barking or wind blowing are heard near the end before abruptly stopping. One can hear static noise akin to what would be expected of a broken record after this point before ending.
