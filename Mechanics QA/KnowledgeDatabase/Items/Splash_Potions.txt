Splash Potions are a special sort of potion that, rather than being consumed, are thrown. They have a small radius of effect around the point of impact.
To create a Splash Potion.
Brew the potion to give it the desired effect. For example, brew a Nether Wart and Spider Eye into a Water Bottle in order to create a Potion of Poison.
Brew gunpowder into the potion.
You should see that the handle of the potion is now curved, indicating that it is a Splash Potion.
Note that simply brewing Gunpowder into a water bottle does not create an effective Splash Potion - you must add reagents first. Also note that adding Gunpowder to a helpful potion will bestow the helpful effects on the mobs and players you splash the potion on.
Splash Potions are thrown rather than consumed. Therefore, when you right-click while holding a Splash Potion, you will throw it, causing it to hit and affect all nearby mobs and/or players. Splash Potions can also be loaded into a dispenser for redstone-controlled attacks.
Note also that when a Splash Potion is used, the bottle is destroyed, as opposed to simply being emptied when you drink from it. And, as with all potions, do not stack. Therefore, you must keep a large reserve of bottles if you wish to use many Potions.

Damage potions are assumed to follow a similar decrease in potency.
