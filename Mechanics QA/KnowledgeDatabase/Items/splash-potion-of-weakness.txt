Splash potions of weakness will reduce your damage output. A splash potion of weakness and a potion of strength will cancel out some of their effect, depending on the strength of the potions.
There are 2 types of potions of weakness. A 90 second version and a 4 minute version. The further you stand from the potionâ€™s blast radius the shorter this time will be. A splash potion of weakness will always reduce your damage output by 2 hearts.
