A Charged Creeper is created when lightning strikes within 3â€“4 blocks of a normal Creeper, which significantly increases its explosive power. This is a rare occurrence, though third-party software and mods can be used to manually create them. Charged Creepers are distinguished from normal Creepers by the blue aura surrounding them. Many players refer to charged Creepers as "Electric" or "Lightning" Creepers. Creepers will never spawn charged.
Charged Creepers take damage from the initial lightning strike, so it takes fewer attacks to kill them than ordinary Creepers. Their countdown timers act the same as uncharged Creepers, both in terms of range and time. An explosion caused by a charged creeper is more powerful than the explosion caused by a regular creeper or from a single block of TNT, both in force and radius.
 The explosion is about twice as powerful than a regular creeper or block of TNT.
 If it explodes a Creeper, Wither Skeleton, Skeleton, Zombie or Player, the victim will drop it's head or skull.
