A Pigman Jockey is a Mob that could technically be considered 2 mobs, since it is actually just a baby Zombie Pigman riding atop a Chicken. A Pigman Jockey has a 5% chance of spawning if lightning strikes within 4 Blocks of a baby Pig, or a 0.25% chance to spawn when a Zombie Pigman spawns in The Nether or is spawned with a Spawn Egg. Additionally, it is possible that any Chicken in the Nether can have a Zombie Pigman spawn on top of it, turning it into a Pigman Jockey.
