Wither Skeleton Jockeys are very rare hostile mobs which can only be created with spawn eggs in Creative Mode, hacking, or cheats on Survival Mode. Whenever a player spawns a spider, it has a 80% chance it will have a wither skeleton riding its back instead of a ordinary Skeleton, making it the first mob to only spawn in creative mode. This mob is possible by the Skeleton's coding, which allows Wither Skeletons to ride spiders. The Wither Skeleton backed the Skeleton's coding, which allows it to ride Spiders, despite them being naturally unable to spawn in the Nether.
