Dracula, is that you?
No, it’s not Dracula – but it is a bat! Introduced in the 1.4 update, bats are perhaps the spookiest passive mobs in Minecraft!
These little guys can be found in any biomes where the light is low. Fittingly, they are most often found in caves. They are most active at night, though occasionally they can be found awake during the day.
Blink and you might miss them! In game, bats are very tiny creatures. Their small bodies are black; making them hard to see, especially in dimly lit areas. They happen to make a “squeaky” noise.
Personality wise; bats are rather shy creatures. They tend to spawn by themselves, sometimes in groups. They are easily scared off by any sort of mob; especially humans.
Blessed with just three hearts, they will never attack another creature. They do have a tendency to fly towards the one who scared them. If killed, they won’t drop anything, so leave these cuties alone!
